# You will write three functions for this exercise. First, write a writeToFile() function with
# two parameters for the filename of the file and the text to write into the file. Second, write an
# appendToFile() function, which is identical to writeToFile() except that the file opens in
# append mode instead of write mode. Finally, write a readFromFile() function with one parameter
# for the filename to open. This function returns the full text contents of the file as a string.

# These Python instructions should generate the file and the assert statement checks that the
# content is correct:

# writeToFile('greet.txt', 'Hello!\n')
# appendToFile('greet.txt', 'Goodbye!\n')
# assert readFromFile('greet.txt') == 'Hello!\nGoodbye!\n'

# This code writes the text 'Hello!\n' and 'Goodbye!\n' to a file named greet.txt, then reads
# in this fileâ€™s content to verify it is correct. You can delete the greet.txt file after running these
# instructions program.
